# #{page.title_md}

There are two kinds of _value_:

- A _reference_ holds state, that is, a reference to another object.
- A value defined as a getter (with, optionally, a matching setter)
  does not directly hold state, instead it defines how a "derived" 
  value is computed.

Crucially, users of the value cannot distinguish a 
reference value from a getter value.

When a value is a member of a type, is it called an _attribute_.

## Usage 

A trivial reference:

    String trivalReference = "Alice";

A trivial getter:

    String trivialSpecifiedGetter => "Bob";


A trivial getter and setter:

    Integer trivialValueWithBlock {
        return i+10;
    }
    assign trivialValueWithBlock {
        i = trivialValueWithBlock-10;
    }
    
The setter uses the `assign` keyword, and has the same name as the 
corresponding getter.

The general form of a value can look like any of these:

<!-- lang:none -->
    ANNOTATIONS
    TYPE exampleReference = INITIAL-EXPRESSION;
    // or
    ANNOTATIONS
    TYPE exampleGetterSpecified => GETTER-EXPRESSION;
    // or
    ANNOTATIONS
    TYPE exampleGetterBlock {
        GETTER-BODY
    }
    // or
    ANNOTATIONS
    TYPE exampleGetterBlock {
        GETTER-BODY
    }
    assign exampleGetterBlock {
        SETTER-BODY
    }

Where:

* `ANNOTATIONS` is a list of value [annotations](../annotation)
* `TYPE` is a [type expression](../type) for the 
  [type the reference](#value_type) returned when the value is evaluated
* `INITIAL-EXPRESSION` is the intial value of the reference
* `GETTER-EXPRESSION` is the [specified value](#function_specifiers) of 
  the getter
* `GETTER-BODY` is a [block](#function_blocks) of statements
* `SETTER-BODY` is a [block](#function_blocks) of statements


## Description

### Value type

A non-local value declaration always specifies the *type* of the value.

#### Type inference

Local value and attribute declarations don't need to explictly declare a 
type, but can instead use [type inference](../type-inference) via the 
`value` keyword.

<!-- try: -->
    void f() {
        value string = ""; //inferred type String
    }

### Reference values

Reference values are just holders of state. 

A toplevel reference represents a "global constant" (or variable).

A reference attribute declared within a class body represents state 
associated with an instance of the class (similar to a *field* in other 
programming languages). 

A local reference (that is, a reference declared within a block) 
represents state associated with execution of that block (similar to a 
*local variable* in other programming languages).

Reference values are computed when the value is specified or assigned
and the exact same instance returned thereafter (unless the value is 
`variable` and is reassigned). 

#### `variable` reference values

If a reference value is annotated 
[`variable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_1_3}/index.html#variable), 
it can be [assigned](#{page.doc_root}/reference/operator/assign) more 
than once. Otherwise it must be [specified](../../statement/specification) 
exactly once. 

The specification or assignment must occur before its first use.

### Getters

A getter defines a derived value that is computed every time the 
value is required (unlike a reference value).

From the point of view of the code evaluating a value, it is impossible 
to determine whether the value is implemented as a reference or as a 
getter. It's even possible to refine a reference with a getter, or vice 
versa.

Like [function declarations](../function), you can either use a 
block of statements or the *fat arrow* (`=>`) syntax if the value can be 
computed from a single expression.

### Setters

A setter defines what to do when a derived variable value is assigned.

From the point of view of the code assigning a value, it is impossible to 
determine whether the value is implemented as a reference or as a setter. 
It's even possible to refine a `variable` reference with a getter/setter
pair, or vice versa.

Every setter must have a corresponding getter with the same name. 

The getter declaration must occur earlier in the body containing the 
setter declaration.

### Attribute receiver

Attribute evaluations have a _receiver_, an instance of the type that 
declares the attribute. Within the getter or setter body, the expression 
[`this`](../../expression/this) refers to this receiving instance.

A [top level](../type-declaration#top_level_declarations) value does not 
have a receiver.


### Different kinds of value

#### `late` values

A value can be declared [`late`](../../annotation/late/) in which case the 
[definite specification](../../annotation/late/#description) validation is 
not performed. 

#### `formal` and `default` attributes

An attribute declaration may be annotated [`formal`](../../annotation/formal)
or [`default`](../../annotation/default). A formal or default attribute must 
also be annotated `shared`.

A formal attribute does not specify an implementation. A formal attribute 
must be refined by concrete classes which inherit the containing class or 
interface. 

A `default` attribute may be refined by types which inherit the containing 
class or interface. 

#### `shared` values

A toplevel value declaration, or a value declaration nested inside the 
body of a containing class or interface, may be annotated 
[`shared`](../../annotation/shared).

- A toplevel `shared` value declaration is visible wherever the package that 
  contains it is visible.
- A `shared` value declaration nested inside a class or interface is visible 
  wherever the containing class or interface is visible.

### Metamodel

Value declarations can be manipulated at runtime via their representation as
[`ValueDeclaration`](#{site.urls.apidoc_1_3}/meta/declaration/ValueDeclaration.type.html) 
instances. An *applied function* (i.e. with all type parameters specified) 
corresponds to either a 
[`Value`](#{site.urls.apidoc_1_3}/meta/model/Value.type.html) or 
[`Attribute`](#{site.urls.apidoc_1_3}/meta/model/Attribute.type.html) model 
instance.
